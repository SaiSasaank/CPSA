# CPSA
Protocols like TLS, PAKE, Diffie-Hellman are playing a vital role in today’s world but are they secure? No matter what the protocol, there are always two parties involved, initiator and responder. With adversaries constantly trying to exploit and manipulate data, it is hard to verify the integrity of the initiator or the responder. This is where CPSA (Cryptographic Protocol Shapes Analyzer) can be used, it assumes the whole network is compromised and gives a detailed explanation of how an adversary can read and alter the data in transit when a protocol is being used.
A given protocol can run in infinitesimal ways to yield a result because of the varying parameters provided by the users. Out of these executions there might be few which are flawed, CPSA looks for those and provides output in the form of shapes – control flow of those flawed executions. A simple analogy for the working of CPSA would be brute forcing a password. In brute forcing we guess all the possible strings for user defines parameters such as password length and sample space {a-z,A-Z,0-9 and special characters}. Similarly, in CPSA the user will define on how the server and client communicate. CPSA will then analyze all the ways in which an attack is possible, i.e., how can an adversary take advantage of the flaws, and put in  shapes which describe if the network messages can be altered, diverted or manipulated in any way.
